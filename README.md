# HyBR-Recycling
This repository contains MATLAB files for hybrid iterative methods with recycling. The codes accompany the paper:

"Hybrid Projection Methods with Recycling for Inverse Problems" - Chung, Sturler and Jiang, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 2020

# Requirements
These codes require the following packages:
Regularization Tools package: Hansen. Regularization tools: A
package for analysis and solution of discrete ill-posed 
problems. Numerical Algorithms, 1994.
         
RestoreTools package: Nagy, Palmer, and Perrone. Iterative 
Methods for image deblurring: A Matlab object oriented 
approach. Numerical Algorithms, 2004.
         
The AIR Tools II toolbox for MATLAB 
accompanies the publication "AIR Tools II: algebraic iterative reconstruction methods, improved implementation", 
Hansen, P. C. & JÃ¸rgensen, J. S. Numer Algor (2017).
